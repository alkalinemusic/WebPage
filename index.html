<h3>Tally Counter program</h3>
<p>
	<b>Tally Counter for product testing:</b><br>
	The inspiration for this app was taken from the tried and true method of counting an event's occurrence in fives; drawing 4 vertical lines and the 5th line being diagonal.<br>
	As a tester of tech equipment, the testing would often require repitions of the same method to determine when certain situations or failures would occur.<br>
	I saw my co-workers and myself sitting with pencil and paper placing 100's of these tally marks and knew that there could be a computerized solution.	<br>
