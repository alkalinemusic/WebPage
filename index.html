<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>This site will serve as a blog, tutorial, as well as a portfolio of my work. 
   I plan on incorporating many of the projects that I've completed as well as
   ones that are currently being developed. <br>
   I would like to start my own programmer blog.<br> 
   I plan on also incorporating tutorials into the site as well.

<h3>Topic 1</h3>
<p>
	Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin consequat tincidunt nisi id hendrerit. Donec pharetra eget quam vel volutpat.

<h3>HTML5 elements</h3>
	<p>
		<b> !DOCTYPE html,main, img, anchor, header, footer, nav, video, article, section<br></b>

		<br>
		The very first element to add to the top of the site is the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;<br>
		This is needed to tell the browser which version of html is being used for your site<br>
		Then the whole page should be wrapped in &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;<br>
		<b> main</b> - wrap paragraphs with the main tag helps search engine and other developers <br>
		find the main content of your page.<br>
		<b>img src=</b> - adds an image to your page. place the url to your picture within quotes.<br>
		Add an <b>alt</b> tag to include text which prints if your picture doesn't load for some reason<br>
		<b>anchor</b> - links to content outside of your webpage.<br>
		Use the <b>a href</b> element to create this link with the url inside quotes
		Internal links can be created with the <b>a href="# </b>. This can link to the footer or header of the page.
		<br>
		Any information about your page should go into the &lt;header&gt; tags<br>
		Any content shown to the user should go within the &lt;body&gt; tags<br>
		<p> A dead link can be created, as a placeholder, by setting the a href="#" such as this <a href="#"target="_blank">This link is dead by design"></a> </p>
		An image can also be turned into a link by enclosing the picture element inside of a link a href tag.
		<p><a href="#"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRGYfEe8uYQeagSBdfAQF1SD8brtpyB0HeQt_ytv_prN7fPQzubDA"></a></p>
		<p>
			<b>Adding a text entry field</b>
			Add a text placeholder inside the text entry field
			<input type="Text" placeholder="This is placeholder text">
			<p>
			<code>
				This is a code example. Simply surround the code with &lt;code&gt;<br></code>
				this is how you can add an entry field that would submit the entered data to a particular url
				&lt;form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;
			<p>
		</p>
		<p>
			How to add a submit button<br>
			&lt;button type="submit"&gt;submit here&lt;/button&gt; <br>
			<button type="submit">submit here</button><br>
			The text field can also be made a required field, so the user has to enter something;<br>
			like this; &lt;input type="text" required &gt;
		</p>
		<p>
			Add radio buttons using the following <br>
			These will be bound to each other because the use the same name attribute, meaning only <br>
			one of them can be selected at a time<br>
			Radio buttons and checkboxes can also be checked by default if desired. Simply add checked to end of input statement <br>
			    <label for="indoor">
				  <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
				</label><br>
				    <label for="outdoor">
				  <input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor
				</label><br>
				<label>
					<input id="underwater" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked>Underwater
				</label>

		</p>
		<p>
			Checkboxes can be added the same way as radio buttons, assigning them to the same name attribute<br>
			    <label for="super fun"><input id="super fun" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Super fun</label><br>
    <label for="wicked weird"><input id="wicked weird" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Wicked Weird</label><br>
    		
    		<label for="wily"><input id="wily" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Wily</label><br>
    		</label>
    		</p>

<h3>Tally Counter program</h3>
<p>
	<b>Tally Counter for product testing:</b><br>
	The inspiration for this app was taken from the tried and true method of counting an event's occurrence in fives; drawing 4 vertical lines and the 5th line being diagonal.<br>
	As a tester of tech equipment, the testing would often require repitions of the same method to determine when certain situations or failures would occur.<br>
	I saw my co-workers and myself sitting with pencil and paper placing 100's of these tally marks and knew that there could be a computerized solution.	<br>

		<li>task 3</li>
	</ul>

	<b>Make an ordered numbered list</b>

	<h1><div align="center" >CSS</div></h1><br>
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li> This section will deal with the CSS functions and usage<br></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	There are three main ways to apply CSS styling. <br>
	You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style attribute. <br>
	Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document. <br>
	Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document.<br> Even though the first two options have their use cases, most developers prefer external style sheets because<br> they keep the styles separate from the HTML elements.
